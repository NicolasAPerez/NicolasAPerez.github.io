            Hello! <br>
            Before continuing to the sections mentioned above in the toolbar, I would like to state that this is
            a "simplified" version of my website intended for easy viewing of the content and text, if you're reading
            this on a desktop computer or laptop I would highly recommend clicking the "Retro" button found above the
            toolbar. This will lead to the feature complete version of the website where most of the work has gone into.
            <br> <br>
            The Retro view is my approximation of using a simple OS desktop with functioning moving windows, and WebGL
            versions of some of my projects where applicable. This also includes a version of Minesweeper made in Unity
            to capture the feeling of an old OS like Windows XP.
