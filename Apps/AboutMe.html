            &emsp;&emsp;  Hi! My name is Nicolas Perez, I’m a recent graduate from the University of Florida,
            the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering to be specific, as a Computer Scientist.
            I’m originally from the capital of Chile, Santiago, but I grew up here in the United States.
            I’m fluent in both English and Spanish due to my upbringing.
            My goals are to be able to work in a position that allows me to create and add something to the world,
            whether that be working on web applications or working on a video game. I really enjoy working on puzzles,
            which is part of why I enjoy programming so much, just the ability to find ways to get code to work as intended
            and seeing the results of that work is intensely satisfying to me. On my own time I love reading, singing, and
            learning to draw pixel art.

        &emsp; &emsp; During my time at University, I made sure to take classes on a variety of topics including my minor
        in electrical engineering. My focus for my classes in my minor was in Boolean logic and learning how to use
        assembly level languages to directly program microcontrollers. During this time, I also used the chance to
        learn some amount of C. I also took classes on Computer Networking, Computer Security to learn some
        cryptography, and a couple of AI classes in which we covered building AI for games and simulations. Within
        those AI classes I learned how to program a variety of AI techniques including Greedy Best First, A-Star,
        Flocking, and more. To help with my own personal passions, I’ve also taken courses on visual and game design
        which allowed me to learn how to work with the Unity game engine and C#.

        The highlight of my academic career at UF would be my time spent in IPPD. During this “course” I spent time
        working on a real project that needed to be used by Raytheon, in what was essentially an internship. To go
        into more specifics, the project I worked on was a training program in use by Raytheon that needed some
        modifications. By starting off from a Scope of Work, to a design proposal, and keeping track of documentation,
        my team of 3 other scholars and I were able to work in a professional environment. We made sure to keep in
        contact with the engineers at Raytheon with weekly scrum meetings and were invited to one of the Raytheon
        locations to present our mid-way progress report. Once past the planning phase, we held quarterly
        presentations to show our work and how on track to finish we were. Overall, our liaison at Raytheon was
        incredibly happy with our work on the project and our additions are in use by Raytheon.
        We kept track of the project through a weekly blog which can be found
